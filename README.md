# LexiAI
LexiAI is a privacy-first, AI-powered assistant that ingests legal and financial documents (PDFs, scanned images, DOCX), extracts and segments clauses, then uses a generative LLM (Vertex AI / Gemini) to produce plain-language summaries, highlight risky or one-sided clauses, and answer clause-specific user questions
